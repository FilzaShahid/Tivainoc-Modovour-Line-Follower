# Tivainoc-Modovour-Line-Follower
A line following robot is developed and is driven using TM4C1233H6PM MICRO CONTROLLER.

The purpose of this Complex Engineering problem is to analyze, specify, design, implement, document, and demonstrate a complete embedded system. Line Following is one of the most important aspects of robotics. A Line Following Robot is an autonomous robot which is able to follow a black line that is drawn on the surface consisting of a contrasting color. It is designed to move automatically and follow the line. The robot uses arrays of optical sensors to identify the line, thus assisting the robot to stay on the track. The array of five sensors makes its movement precise and flexible. The robot is driven by DC motors to control the movement of the wheels. The Microcontroller TIVA Board (Cortex M-4 TM4C1233H6PM) interface will be used to perform and implement algorithms to control the speed of the motors, steering the robot to travel along the line smoothly.
